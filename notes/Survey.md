    6.7M US caselaw documents across 360 years are available to download
    Many of these are obviously scanned PDFs

    Following are cursory observations in document https://cite.case.law/pdf/4702260/People%20v.%20Carr,%20255%20Ill.%20203%20(1912).pdf
    - The word "SAME --" at section 3 in pg 203, its not searchable
    - Some of commas "," highlights are false positives
    - Something as simple as quotation is not searchable
    - A word hyphenated b/w two lines isn't searchable
